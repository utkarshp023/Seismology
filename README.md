# Seismology
This programme is supposed to calculate all the necessary data required to calculate the Quality factor i.e. Qc which is 
inversaly propotional to the attenuation of seismic waves. 
The math in this programme is derived from the research done by Aki(1980) and others.
The code is java based, and an external java code for determining the slopes is used.
